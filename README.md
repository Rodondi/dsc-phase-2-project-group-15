## Data Cleaning and Preparation

Before conducting any analysis or building predictive models, it's crucial to ensure the dataset is clean and free from inconsistencies. In this project, we performed the following data cleaning and preparation steps:

1. **Handling Missing Data:** We carefully identified columns with missing values and decided on appropriate strategies to address them. Depending on the nature and significance of missing data, we either imputed missing values or, in some cases, removed rows or columns with excessive missing data. This ensures that our analysis is based on as complete a dataset as possible.

2. **Dealing with Outliers:** Outliers can significantly impact model performance and distort insights. We employed robust techniques to detect and handle outliers in numerical features, such as the sale price, square footage, and more. This step helps in creating more robust and reliable predictive models.

3. **Addressing Data Integrity:** We verified data integrity by checking for inconsistencies and errors in the dataset. This involved examining data types, unique identifiers, and ensuring that categorical variables contain valid categories.

4. **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Many machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs. We encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to ensure compatibility with these models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Checking Statistical Details

We initiated our analysis by examining the statistical details of the numerical columns using the `df.describe()` function. This summary provided us with insights into the dataset's central tendencies, spreads, and potential outliers. Some notable statistics include:

- **Price**: The mean sale price is approximately $540,297, with a wide range of values, ranging from $78,000 to $7,700,000.

- **Bedrooms**: The dataset contains a wide distribution of bedroom counts, with a maximum of 33. There were outliers in this column, which we addressed.

- **Square Footage**: Various square footage metrics (e.g., living space, lot size) exhibit diverse ranges.

### Handling Outliers

We identified outliers in the `bedrooms` column with entries exceeding 20 bedrooms. These were replaced with the median value to ensure data integrity and prevent undue influence on our analyses.

## Feature Engineering

#### Feature 1: Sales vs. Seasons

We introduced a new feature, `season`, to capture the season in which a property was sold. This involved extracting the month from the `date` column and mapping it to the corresponding season (Spring, Summer, Autumn, or Winter). Analyzing sales patterns by season revealed valuable insights.

![Average Selling Price Vs Season](path_to_image)
*Average Selling Price Vs Season: This plot illustrates the average selling price across different seasons, highlighting seasonal variations in property sales.*

**Business Problem 1 Explanation**: The analysis indicates that Summer has the highest average sales, potentially due to favorable warm weather for property hunting. In contrast, Winter experiences the lowest number of sales. Stakeholders may consider adjusting their marketing and pricing strategies based on these seasonal patterns, focusing marketing efforts during Spring and Summer to maximize high property sales.

#### Feature 2: Age

We calculated the age of each property by subtracting the year built (`yr_built`) from the year of sale. This feature, `age`, provides insights into property age and its potential impact on prices.

#### Feature 3: Renovation

A binary feature, `renovated`, was created to indicate whether a property underwent renovation based on the `yr_renovated` column.

These feature engineering steps set the stage for more advanced analyses and predictive modeling, as we delve deeper into understanding the factors affecting property prices in King County.

## Feature Selection
 
### Defining Features and Target Variable

To begin, we defined our features (independent variables) and the target variable (the variable we aim to predict). The target variable, `price`, represents the sale price of properties. We constructed our feature matrix, `X`, by excluding the `price` and `date` columns, as the latter is non-numeric and does not directly contribute to our predictive model. The target variable, `y`, was set as the `price`.

### Data Splitting

To assess our model's performance, we divided the data into training and test sets. This splitting was achieved using the `train_test_split` function, with 80% of the data allocated to training and 20% for testing. A random seed (`random_state`) of 42 was utilized for reproducibility.

### Correlation Analysis

We employed correlation analysis to measure the strength of the relationship between each feature and the target variable, `price`. The correlation coefficient quantifies this relationship, with values closer to 1 indicating a strong positive correlation and values closer to -1 indicating a strong negative correlation. Features with correlations close to 0 are considered weakly correlated with the target variable.

Here are some key findings from the correlation analysis:

- **Strong Positive Correlations**: Features such as `sqft_living`, `grade`, `sqft_above`, and `sqft_living15` exhibit strong positive correlations with the `price`. These features are likely to have a significant impact on property prices.

- **Moderate Positive Correlations**: Features like `bathrooms`, `sqft_basement`, and `bedrooms` also positively correlate with `price`, although to a slightly lesser extent.

- **Weak Correlations**: Some features, such as `zipcode`, `age`, and `season`, display weak correlations with `price`, indicating a less pronounced relationship.

- **Negative Correlations**: While most features have positive correlations, there are no strong negative correlations, suggesting that none of the features have an overwhelmingly negative impact on property prices.

### Visualizing Correlations

A correlation heatmap was created to visually represent the correlations between numerical features. This heatmap provides a clear overview of the relationships between features and can help identify multicollinearity, where two or more features are highly correlated with each other.

![Correlation Heatmap Excluding 'date' and 'id'](path_to_image)
*Correlation Heatmap Excluding 'date' and 'id': This heatmap visually presents the correlations between numerical features, offering insights into feature relationships and potential multicollinearity.*

## Modelling

### Creating a Baseline Model

We established a baseline model to benchmark our future models' performance. We utilized the `DummyRegressor` from scikit-learn, which predicts property prices without considering any features. This baseline model helped us gauge the effectiveness of more advanced models.

#### Baseline Model Results

- **R-squared**: 0.0
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 368,958.05
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 235,058.25

### Model 1: Using Key Property Features

For our first predictive model, we selected a subset of features based on their strong positive correlations with the target variable (`price`) and their representation of essential property characteristics. The features include 'bedrooms', 'bathrooms', 'sqft_living', 'sqft_lot', and 'floors'.

#### Model 1 Results

- **Mean RMSE**: 257,825.19
- **Standard Deviation of RMSE**: 17,760.72

### Model 2: Adding Grade and Condition Features

In our second model, we expanded the feature set to include 'grade' and 'condition.' These features assess the overall quality, construction, and maintenance of properties, which can significantly influence property prices.

#### Model 2 Results

- **Mean RMSE**: 244,080.75
- **Standard Deviation of RMSE**: 19,250.64

### Model 3: Incorporating Renovation Status

Our third model introduced the 'renovated' feature to the set. This feature indicates whether a property has undergone renovation. Renovations can impact a property's overall condition and, consequently, its pricing.

#### Model 3 Results

- **Mean RMSE**: 241,808.57
- **Standard Deviation of RMSE**: 18,716.30

### Model Comparison and Selection

Throughout our modeling process, we evaluated each model's performance using root mean squared error (RMSE) as the primary metric. Lower RMSE values indicate better predictive accuracy. Model 3, with the addition of the 'renovated' feature, achieved the lowest mean RMSE, making it the preferred choice for predicting property prices in the King County dataset.

## Challenges

We encountered several significant challenges that are common in real estate data analysis and predictive modeling. These challenges added complexity to the project and required creative solutions:
